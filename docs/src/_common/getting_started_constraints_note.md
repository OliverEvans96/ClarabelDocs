!!! note
    Note carefully the signs in the above example.   The inequality condition is ``A_{ineq} x \le b_{ineq}``, which is equivalent to ``A_{ineq} x + s = b_{ineq}`` with ``s \ge 0``, i.e. ``s`` in the Nonnegative cone.    The SOC condition is ``x \in \mathcal{K}_{SOC}``, or equivalently ``-x + s = 0`` with ``s \in \mathcal{K}_{SOC}``.
